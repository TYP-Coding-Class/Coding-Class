# TYP Coding Class


Everyone‚Äôs talking about coding and programming, but where do you start? 


So me and my Team  <a href="https://github.com/Team-TYP"/><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white"></a> decided to make this class.

If you are new to programming, we recommend you start at the beginning and earn these certifications in order.

To earn each certification, build its 5 required projects and get all their tests to pass.

You can add these certifications to your Resume or Github or LinkedIn. But more important than the certifications is the practice you get along the way.

If you feel overwhelmed, that is normal. Programming is hard.
Practice is the key. Practice, practice, practice.




This path will give you an introduction to the world of code and basic concepts of programming. By the end, you‚Äôll have the basic knowledge of programming.

Our mission is to generate interest in the field of programming and help our students develop skills that will improve their critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making ability.

# What Is Coding?


To start with, we need to define what coding is. Most programmers would agree that coding is:


- *"The act of writing code that is compiled to form programs, that can be executed by a computer or a code reader, and that has a specific function or set of functions."*


- Now, this definition is quite broad. In reality, exactly what we mean by coding will depend on what sort of coding we are referring to.

- For example, a web developer writes code that is used to build responsive, functioning websites. In this sense, coding is creating the best possible website. You can learn more about coding oon your own.

- However, someone who works in navigation and aerospace engineering might be required to write code that lets an airplane run on autopilot during long journeys. Although this is entirely different from building a website, it is still coding.


- Before you start learning ‚ÄúCoding‚Äù, you, therefore, need to think carefully about what sort of coding you would like to do.

# What is Programming?


In this class, we will decipher the term ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù and understand its usage and many other related terms.

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++. 

**Understanding Programming in layman terms**

   > Programming is a way to ‚Äúinstruct the computer to perform various tasks‚Äù.

Confusing right? Let us understand the definition deeply.

- **‚ÄúInstruct the computer‚Äù:** this basically means that you provide the computer a set of instructions that are written in a language that the computer can understand. 

The instructions could be of various types. For example:

    -- Adding 2 numbers,
    -- Rounding off a number, etc.

Just like we humans can understand a few languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, French, etc.), so is the case with computers. 

Computers understand instructions that are written in a specific syntactical form called "Coding" (also known as Programming Language).
